# Section 10 - Course Project - The Learning Resources App  
###### **Note**: After completing Section 9 I skipped to Section 19 - The Composition API - Replacing the Options API, and completed most of the sections there. I say this because I will be using the Composition API going forward, and information about that can be found in Section 19.  

Here we will build a Vue app using all the features we've learned so far.
